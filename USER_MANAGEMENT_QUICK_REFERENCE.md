## 🎓 Developer Notes

### Adding Toast to New Feature
1. `import { toast } from "sonner";`
2. `toast.loading("Operation...")` at start
3. `toast.dismiss(id)` after operation
4. `toast.success()` or `toast.error()` for result

### New User Flow
1. Dialog opens → Form renders
2. User fills form
3. Validation checks
4. Create button clicked
5. Loading toast shows
6. API call executes
7. Success/error toast shows
8. Form resets + dialog closes

### Best Practices
- Always validate before API call
- Show loading toast before async operation
- Dismiss loading toast before result toast
- Use user-friendly error messages
- Update UI before/after toast
- Handle all error cases
