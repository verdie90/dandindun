# User Management Enhancements - Complete Guide

## Overview

The user management system has been significantly enhanced with new features and comprehensive toast notifications. This document outlines all new capabilities, implementation details, and usage patterns.

## 🎯 New Features

### 1. Create New User (New User Dialog)

**Location**: `/[locale]/admin/users`

**Button**: "New User" button in the top-right corner of the User Management page (only visible with `canCreate` permission)

**Features**:
- ✅ Full name input field
- ✅ Email address input with validation
- ✅ Secure password input with minimum 6 character requirement
- ✅ Password confirmation field
- ✅ Role selection (User, Moderator, Admin)
- ✅ Form validation with helpful error messages
- ✅ Real-time validation feedback
- ✅ Loading state during user creation
- ✅ Success toast notification with user name
- ✅ Automatic form reset after successful creation
- ✅ Auto-reload of user list and stats

**Validation Rules**:
- Name: Required, non-empty
- Email: Required, valid email format (contains @ and domain)
- Password: Required, minimum 6 characters, must match confirmation
- Role: Required, selected from dropdown

**Error Handling**:
```
- "Name is required" → Shows if name is empty
- "Email is required" → Shows if email is empty
- "Please enter a valid email address" → Shows if email format is invalid
- "Password is required" → Shows if password is empty
- "Password must be at least 6 characters" → Shows if password is too short
- "Passwords do not match" → Shows if passwords don't match
```

### 2. Comprehensive Toast Notifications

Toast notifications have been integrated into **every user action** for real-time feedback.

#### Toast Types & Examples

**Success Toasts** (Green with checkmark):
- "User 'John Doe' created successfully"
- "john.doe@gmail.com's role updated to Admin"
- "Jane Smith has been activated"
- "Bob Johnson has been deactivated"
- "bob.johnson@gmail.com has been banned - Spam account"
- "alice.smith@gmail.com has been unbanned"
- "charlie.brown@gmail.com has been deleted"
- "jane.smith@gmail.com's information updated successfully"
- "michael.wilson@gmail.com's password has been changed"
- "Bulk action completed: 5 user(s) updated"

**Error Toasts** (Red with X icon):
- "Name is required" → Validation error
- "Please enter a valid email address" → Validation error
- "Password must be at least 6 characters" → Validation error
- "Passwords do not match" → Validation error
- "[Error message from server]" → API error
- "Failed to create user" → Generic creation error
- "Failed to update user role" → Generic update error
- "Failed to activate user" → Generic activation error
- "Failed to deactivate user" → Generic deactivation error
- "Failed to ban user" → Generic ban error
- "Failed to unban user" → Generic unban error
- "Failed to delete user" → Generic delete error
- "Failed to edit user" → Generic edit error
- "Failed to change password" → Generic password change error
- "Failed to complete bulk action" → Generic bulk action error
- "5 user(s) failed to update" → Partial bulk action failure

**Loading Toasts** (With spinner):
- "Creating new user..." → Shown while creating
- "Updating user role..." → Shown while updating role
- "Deactivating user..." → Shown while deactivating
- "Activating user..." → Shown while activating
- "Banning user..." → Shown while banning
- "Unbanning user..." → Shown while unbanning
- "Deleting user..." → Shown while deleting
- "Updating user info..." → Shown while editing
- "Changing password..." → Shown while changing password

All loading toasts are automatically dismissed and replaced with success/error toasts.

### Toast Configuration

**Location**: `components/ui/sonner.tsx`

**Features**:
- ✅ Theme-aware (respects light/dark mode)
- ✅ Custom icons with Lucide React
- ✅ Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds for success messages
- ✅ TailwindCSS styling
- ✅ Smooth animations

**Usage**:
```typescript
import { toast } from "sonner";

// Success
toast.success("User created successfully");

// Error
toast.error("Failed to create user");

// Loading (auto-dismiss)
const toastId = toast.loading("Creating user...");
// ... do async work ...
toast.dismiss(toastId);
toast.success("User created!");

// Promise
toast.promise(promise, {
  loading: 'Loading...',
  success: 'Success!',
  error: 'Error!'
});
```

## 📋 Enhanced Operations

All existing CRUD operations now have complete toast notification support:

## 🔐 Permission Integration

The "New User" button is only visible to users with `canCreate("/admin/users")` permission.

**Permission Matrix**:
```
CREATE USER:     canCreate("/admin/users")
UPDATE USER:     canUpdate("/admin/users") 
DELETE USER:     canDelete("/admin/users")
BAN USER:        isOperationAllowed("banUser")
EDIT INFO:       canUpdate("/admin/users")
CHANGE PASSWORD: canUpdate("/admin/users")
```

## 🏗️ Code Implementation

### New State Variables

```typescript
// New user form dialog states
const [newUserDialogOpen, setNewUserDialogOpen] = useState(false);
const [newUserForm, setNewUserForm] = useState({
  name: "",
  email: "",
  password: "",
  confirmPassword: "",
  role: "user" as UserRole,
});
```

### New Functions

#### handleCreateNewUser()
Creates a new user with validation, role assignment, and auto-reload.

```typescript
const handleCreateNewUser = async () => {
  // Validates all fields
  // Checks email format
  // Checks password requirements
  // Calls registerUser()
  // Updates role if not default
  // Reloads user list and stats
  // Shows success toast
  // Resets form
};
```

#### Enhanced Existing Functions

All existing functions now include:
1. Loading toast at start
2. Actual operation
3. UI state update
4. Toast dismissal
5. Success/error toast display
6. Error handling with user-friendly messages
7. Finally block to clear processing state

**Functions Enhanced**:
